            I've done gymnastics my entire life, and it is easily my favorite sport. I've spent countless hours in the gym, and now am on the Club Gymnastics Team at Notre Dame.

            One of my favorite things about summer is being able to spend time waterskiing at our family cabin in Idaho. Plus, it is great practice for club waterski season!

            Running is one of my favorite ways to get outside and enjoy all of the parks and forests that I am surrounded by in the Pacific Northwest.

            Believe it or not, I am not on the football teamâ€”just a dedicated fan whose happiness is decided by a team that I have no influence over.

            I'm no chef, but I love making pizza. Pro tip: pickles are actually really good on pizza (also pineapple). Now, I am the manager for Zaland, which is the pizzeria in my dorm, which sells dollar slices every night.

            I've been a greenskeeper at a local golf course over the past two summers, and nothing beats the sunrises over a beautiful course.

            If you can't tell, I'm a huge fan of squirrels. That cute guy on the left is named Scrat (after the squirrel from Ice Age) and was nice enough to bite my finger in Albuquerque on a Club Gymnastics trip.
